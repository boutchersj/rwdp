//Images can appear "retina" if you cut the original file's height & width in half (this example had 200 x 200 px in the original)//
//"Retina display" is a term in the tech world that refers to pixel density and resolution//
//A smartphone can be considered to have a "retina" display if its pixels cannot be seen 12 inches from the device//
//The iPhone 8+ has a retina display at 326ppi (pixels per inch)//

//By cutting the image file's width and height in half, you increase pixel density, which gives the image this "retina" effect/
