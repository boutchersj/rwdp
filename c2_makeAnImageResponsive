<style>
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
    height: auto;
  }
</style>

//Making images responsive is easy//
//Don't set an absolute height and width//
//Max-width fits the element to the width of its container//
//Block display gives the element its own line (takes it out of inline status)//
//Auto height adjusts height to keep the original height-width ratio after max-width changes width//

//This is the pure-CSS version of the img-responsive class in Bootstrap//
